Include-
name of the service generating the log message
correlation Id
username that triggered the action
name of the machine or id of the container
message receipt date in UTC
message send date in UTC
full body of the triggering message

When? — Time (with full date format): It doesn’t require using UTC format. But the timezone has to be the same for everyone that needs to look at the logs.
What? — Stack errors: All exception objects should be passed to the logging system.
Where? — Besides service name as we using MSA. We also need function name, class or file name where the error occurred. — Don’t guess anything, it might waste your time.
Who? — The IP address of the client and user name if any. Make sure don’t use this information to blame your teammates :)
